Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.InstructionsDownload the data: Download the data from the project page.Place the files: Unzip the downloaded file and place the UCI HAR Dataset folder in your RStudio working directory.
Run the script: Open run_analysis.R in RStudio and run it.
Upon completion, a file named tidy_data.txt will be created in your working directory.
File Structurerun_analysis.R: This is the main script for the project.CodeBook.md: This document describes the variables, values, and transformations included in tidy_data.txt.README.md: This document.
