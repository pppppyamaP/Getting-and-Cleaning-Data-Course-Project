CodeBookData SourceThe data used in this project was collected from the accelerometers and gyroscopes of a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. The data was recorded while 30 volunteers, aged 19-48, performed six activities: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING.Dataset VariablesThe final tidy data set, generated by the run_analysis.R script, contains the following variables:Identifierssubject_id: The ID of the subject (an integer from 1 to 30).activity_id: The descriptive name of the activity performed by the subject (e.g., WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS).MeasurementsThe remaining variables in the data set are the averages of the mean() and std() measurements, which were extracted from the original data and then averaged for each subject and activity. The variable names are based on the original features.txt and have been made more descriptive.tBodyAcc-mean()-X: The mean of the time-domain body acceleration signal (X-axis).tBodyAcc-std()-X: The standard deviation of the time-domain body acceleration signal (X-axis).tGravityAcc-mean()-X: The mean of the time-domain gravity acceleration signal (X-axis).tGravityAcc-std()-X: The standard deviation of the time-domain gravity acceleration signal (X-axis)....and so on, including a total of 66 mean and standard deviation measurements.Data Transformation and CleaningThe run_analysis.R script transforms the original raw data into the final tidy data set in the following steps:File Loading and Merging: X_train.txt and X_test.txt (measurements), y_train.txt and y_test.txt (activity labels), and subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt (subject IDs) are loaded and merged into a single large dataset.Variable Extraction: Using the features.txt file, only columns with variable names containing mean() and std() are extracted.Descriptive Activity Naming: The numeric labels (1-6) from the y_ files are replaced with the corresponding descriptive activity names (e.g., WALKING) from the activity_labels.txt file.Tidy Data Set Creation: The group_by() and summarise() functions from the dplyr package are used to calculate the average of all measurement variables for each subject and activity.File Output: The final tidy data set is output as a file named tidy_data.txt.
